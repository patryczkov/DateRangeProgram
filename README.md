# DateRangeProgram
It is a small program which, when starting from a terminal, when giving arguments, gives the time interval between dates.

To start the program, type >\program.exe dd.mm.yyyy dd.mm.yyyy, for the EU(default) format,
or >\program.exe mm.dd.yyyyy mm.dd.yyyyy us, for US format

If you run the program with the debug parameter, a comparison of saved dates for the EU format will start.
The program has unit tests written.

TODO
-to make the years read independently of the number of digits (now it works on 0001 A.D.)
-to decide if integration tests make sense
